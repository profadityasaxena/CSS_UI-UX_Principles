# 🌐 From Semantics to Aesthetics: Mastering HTML and CSS for High-Impact Web Design

A research-driven personal portfolio project that explores the intersection of semantic HTML structure and expressive CSS aesthetics. This project was developed as part of an academic investigation into modern web design systems, with an emphasis on responsive layouts, visual storytelling, and scalable architecture.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Understand and implement semantic HTML for accessibility and maintainability.
- Master core CSS layout models: Box Model, Flexbox, CSS Grid.
- Apply modern CSS features (custom properties, transitions, clip-path, etc.) for rich visual interaction.
- Design and publish a high-impact, responsive personal portfolio site.
- Document best practices and annotate design decisions in a reusable codebase.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Semantic markup for accessible structure.
- **CSS3** – Advanced layout and styling (Flexbox, Grid, Custom Properties, Transitions, etc.)
- **No frameworks** – Pure HTML and CSS for full control and learning.
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control and project documentation.
- **GitHub Pages / Netlify** – Deployment of the portfolio site.

## 🧠 Research Highlights

This project is part of a larger academic paper answering the following questions:

1. How does semantic HTML enhance accessibility and maintainability?
2. What layout systems are best suited for scalable, responsive design?
3. How can advanced CSS techniques (transforms, transitions, clip-path) enhance interaction?
4. How do pattern libraries and design systems improve scalability?
5. What are best practices for structuring and debugging large-scale CSS?
6. How to design a portfolio that is both technically sound and creatively distinguished?

## 🧪 Development Process

- 🔍 **Code Deconstruction**: Analyzed and annotated HTML/CSS from award-winning sites.
- 🎨 **Mini Projects**: Built responsive cards, navbars, galleries, and animations.
- 💬 **Peer Reviews**: Incorporated usability feedback into iterative designs.
- 📈 **Version Control**: All changes tracked with annotated commits.

## 📖 Documentation

Each page and component is documented with inline comments. Design decisions are explained in `docs/decisions.md` (optional), including:

- Layout system choice rationale.
- Accessibility enhancements.
- Reusability patterns via custom properties and utility classes.
